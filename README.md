# Blinkit Sales Report 
---

## Project Overview 
The goal of this report is to provide insights into the sales performance of Blinkit, an online grocery store based in India. By analyzing the sales data based on various dimensions, I seek to identify trends, make data driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's perfomance. 

## Data Sources 
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Blinkit Grocery Dashboard.xlsx" file. The file contains four sheets. These are:-
- Raw Data Blinkit Grocery - contains the raw uncleaned data.
- Clean Blinkit Grocery - contains the clean and formatted data.
- Pivot tables - the various pivot tables and charts.
- Dashboard - final report.

## Tools 
The only tool used in the creation of this report is **Excel** (*data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization*).

## Data preparation and Cleaning
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and formatting
   - Item fat content had inconsistencies -LF and reg were replaced with Low Fat and regular respectively.
   - The data was then formated into a table "Blinkit_Grocery_Data".

EDA involved exploring the data to answer questions such as:
1. What is the total sales?
2. What is the average sales?
3. What is the total number of items sold?
4. What is the average rating?
5. How does item fat content affect sales?
